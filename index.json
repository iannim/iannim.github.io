The security, safety and privacy are constantly under attack due to the huge number of easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities in these devices. It is straightforward to notice how a careful analysis of IoT devices is more topical and urgent than ever and it is important to adopt effective vulnerability assessment methodologies in order to identify and thwart many types of cyberattacks. In order to perform traditional analyses on the firmware, however, it is important to emulate the latter in a controlled environment: a process called firmware re-hosting. In this paper we discuss the limitations of the existing re-hosting approaches when dealing with vulnerability assessment and we propose a novel methodology to speed up security analyses and allow the application to firmware of traditional security tools, such as binary fuzzers.","tags":[""],"title":"Enabling Faster Security Assessment of Re-hosted Firmware","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giancarlo Fortino","Claudia Greco","Antonella Guzzo","Michele Ianni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"51147ab905d5ca011e28f53f91793aae","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/fortino-2022-identification/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.960926Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fortino-2022-identification/","section":"publication","summary":"The task of identifying malicious activities in logs and predicting threats is crucial nowadays in industrial sector. In this paper, we focus on the identification of past malicious activities and in the prediction of future threats by proposing a novel technique based on the combination of Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTTP) and Neural Networks. Differently from the traditional formulation of Temporal Point Processes, our method does not make any prior assumptions on the functional form of the conditional intensity function and on the distribution of the events. Our approach is based the adoption of Neural Networks with the goal of improving the capabilities of learning arbitrary and unknown event distributions by taking advantage of the Deep Learning theory. We conduct a series of experiments using industrial data coming from gas pipelines, showing that our framework is able to represent in a convenient way the information gathered from the logs and predict future menaces in an unsupervised way, as well as classifying the past ones. The results of the experimental evaluation, showing outstanding values for precision and recall, confirm the effectiveness of our approach.","tags":null,"title":"Identification and prediction of attacks to industrial control systems using temporal point processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giancarlo Fortino","Claudia Greco","Antonella Guzzo","Michele Ianni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"e22601f49507b805cbb4b0083f015652","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/9850333/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.961562Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9850333/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Neural Network based Temporal Point Processes for Attack Detection in Industrial Control Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d479592e3ed56a05c0e1763223125286","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2022-some/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.962092Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2022-some/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Some Experiments on High Performance Anomaly Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"e55ef1849bf3c7b4ac1f184e925724b0","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2021-compact/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.964213Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2021-compact/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A compact encoding of security logs for high performance activity detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giancarlo Fortino","Antonella Guzzo","Michele Ianni","Francesco Leotta","Massimo Mecella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"dd5fa73b0cc2e63cc24827e1958106d5","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/fortino-2021-activity/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.963765Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fortino-2021-activity/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Activity Daily Living prediction with Marked Temporal Point Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giancarlo Fortino","Antonella Guzzo","Michele Ianni","Francesco Leotta","Massimo Mecella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"1f127dabb1c15f9b7b9c5173a771e0e5","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/fortino-2021-predicting/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.963071Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fortino-2021-predicting/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Predicting activities of daily living via temporal point processes: Approaches and experimental results","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"e0b8421d0f33c2023f2547f0fac3ceb9","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2021-some/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.963436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2021-some/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Some experiments on activity outlier detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Quarta","Michele Ianni","Aravind Machiry","Yanick Fratantonio","Eric Gustafson","Davide Balzarotti","Martina Lindorfer","Giovanni Vigna","Christopher Kruegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"7d93d1edccd508d3f51b777d28e9d4c2","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/quarta-2021-tarnhelm/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.962605Z","relpermalink":"/publication/quarta-2021-tarnhelm/","section":"publication","summary":"Protecting the confidentiality of applications on commodity operating systems, both on desktop and mobile devices, is challenging: attackers have unrestricted control over an application's processes and thus direct access to any of the application's assets. However, the application's code itself can be of great commercial value, for example in the case of proprietary code or additional functionality obtained as downloadable content and via in-app purchases, which are widely used to monetize free applications through premium content. Developers still rely heavily on obfuscation to protect their own code from unauthorized tampering or copying, providing an obstacle for an attacker, but not preventing compromise. In this paper, we present Tarnhelm, an approach to offer a practical and transparent primitive to implement code confidentiality by extending ARM's TrustZone, a TEE that so far provides limited functionality to application developers. Tarnhelm allows developers to easily designate part of their code as confidential through source code annotations. At compile time, Tarnhelm automatically partitions the application into regular application code, executed in the \"normal world,\" and the invisible code, transparently executed in the \"secure world.\" Tarnhelm tightly couples and secures the execution in both worlds without exposing any additional attack surface by combining a number of different techniques, such as secure code loading, system call forwarding, transparent world switching, and the enforcement of inter-world control-flow integrity. We im- plemented a proof of concept of Tarnhelm and demonstrate its feasibility in a mobile computing setting.","tags":["code confidentiality","trustzone"],"title":"Tarnhelm: Isolated, Transparent \u0026 Confidential Execution of Arbitrary Code in ARM's TrustZone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Giancarlo Sperlı́"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"adcd203a47cc55af0dac95aa325846d2","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2020-survey/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.964537Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2020-survey/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A survey of Big Data dimensions vs Social Networks analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The main sources for data analysis are the activity logs that are produced in large volumes at run time and are often characterized by semantically rich properties. The paper proposes a framework for analyzing the collected logs in order to provide the defenders with relevant insights on the attacks that have been conducted. The framework consists of two ingredients: (i) a modeling language to define the patterns of attacks that are of interest to the defenders, and (ii) an algorithm that is able to identify, in an input log, all possible attacks conforming to the given patterns. The paper presents a formalization of the modeling language and a study of its properties from a theoretical viewpoint as well as the algorithm (along with an ad-hoc data structure) that is proven to be very efficient in the identification of attacks in real world scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling and efficiently detecting security-critical sequences of actions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sergio Greco","Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Domenico Saccà","Irina Trubitsyna"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0736a9bb6fffca95f51ed61f12e779be","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dblp-confsebd-greco-imst-20/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.965615Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confsebd-greco-imst-20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Smart Data Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Domenico Saccà"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"cf7f92f34e67b0927270aedd76fa2aff","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dblp-confdata-ianni-ms-19/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.96629Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confdata-ianni-ms-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Overview of the Endless Battle between Virus Writers and Detectors: How Compilers Can Be Used as an Evasion Technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Domenico Saccà"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"986663bde358b4b92695422dff59cc98","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dblp-confsebd-ianni-ms-19/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.966633Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confsebd-ianni-ms-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exotic Compilers as a Malware Evasion Technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nunziato Cassavia","Sergio Flesca","Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Giuseppe Papuzzo","Chiara Pulice"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"33a939f3290bf93b9ea3b615b6e5decf","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/cassavia-fimpp-19/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T09:31:41.967266Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cassavia-fimpp-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"High Performance Computing by the Crowd","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Giuseppe M.
