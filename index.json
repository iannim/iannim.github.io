In the presence of an illegal copy of the program, the owner can reliably claim her rights by extracting the watermark from the program itself. In this paper, we introduce a new software watermarking technique which can be used even with compiled programs. The proposed technique is dynamic: the watermark can be recovered during the execution of the program and it is related to a specific path of execution that is triggered by a given input. We illustrate the technique by means of a watermarking protocol for C/C++/C# source code which tackles many different challenges in the task of encoding the watermark, embedding it into a source code and extracting it from a compiled program. We show the validity of our approach by proving its robustness against common attacks.","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting number theory for dynamic software watermarking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahui Chen","Hang Xiao","Yushan Zheng","Mohammad Mehedi Hassan","Michele Ianni","Antonella Guzzo","Giancarlo Fortino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"fa71f9b3f53fb9e076944f60956d678f","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/chen-2023100871/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T13:18:25.494117Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2023100871/","section":"publication","summary":"Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol that protects distributed services on the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data. In a distributed scenario, entities must prove their identity to a trusted third party using shared secrets, such as secret keys. Traditional schemes typically use a trusted central organization, like a Key Distribution Center, for identity authentication. However, Kerberos has some downsides, such as a single point of failure, vulnerability to replay attacks, and potential credential exposure, which can compromise system security. To address these problems, researchers have been working on various solutions, but most have their own drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Kerberos Secure Service-Management Protocol (DKSM) based on blockchain technology and Ciphertext-policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) schema. Compared with existing protocols, DKSM fulfills decentralization, fine-grained access control with effective cost, and scalability simultaneously. DKSM uses AES and Fast Attribute-Based Encryption with Optimal Security (FABEO) as its cryptographic basis. We also discuss the security of DKSM and demonstrate how our protocol can defend against attacks. Finally, tests on the Ethereum testnet and FISCO consortium platform have shown that our designed protocol is efficient and cost-effective.","tags":["internet of things(iot)","kerberos","blockchain","service security"],"title":"DKSM: A Decentralized Kerberos Secure Service-Management Protocol for Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diletta Chiaro","Edoardo Prezioso","Michele Ianni","Fabio Giampaolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"d3b3a078109a0b81c3ac130ec02f47ac","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/chiaro-2023101836/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T13:18:25.494797Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chiaro-2023101836/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated Learning (FL), which enables multiple clients to cooperatively train global models without revealing private data, has gained significant attention from researchers in recent years. However, the data samples on each participating device in FL are often not independent and identically distributed (IID), leading to significant statistical heterogeneity challenges. In this paper, we propose FL-Enhance, a novel framework to address the non-IID-ness data issue in FL by leveraging established solutions such as data selection, data compression, and data augmentation. FL-Enhance, specifically, utilizes cGANs that are trained locally on the server level, which represents a relatively novel approach within the FL framework. Also, data compression techniques are applied to preserve privacy during data sharing between clients and servers. We compare our framework with the commonly used SMOTE data augmentation technique and test it with different FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedNova, and FedOpt. We conducted experiments using both image and tabular data to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The experimental findings show that FL-Enhance can substantially enhance the performance of the trained models in situations of severe pathological clients while still preserving privacy, which is the fundamental requirement in the FL context.","tags":["federated learning","non-iid data","data fusion","model fusion"],"title":"FL-Enhance: A federated learning framework for balancing non-IID data with augmented and shared compressed samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"45d5432dfdc6772ebef75a59bcd3de79","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2023103355/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T13:18:25.49446Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2023103355/","section":"publication","summary":"The current increase in cybercrime is demanding more effective and efficient data exploration and analysis solutions that can help analysts to detect cyberattacks.

The security, safety and privacy are constantly under attack due to the huge number of easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities in these devices. It is straightforward to notice how a careful analysis of IoT devices is more topical and urgent than ever and it is important to adopt effective vulnerability assessment methodologies in order to identify and thwart many types of cyberattacks. In order to perform traditional analyses on the firmware, however, it is important to emulate the latter in a controlled environment: a process called firmware re-hosting.

Our approach is based the adoption of Neural Networks with the goal of improving the capabilities of learning arbitrary and unknown event distributions by taking advantage of the Deep Learning theory. We conduct a series of experiments using industrial data coming from gas pipelines, showing that our framework is able to represent in a convenient way the information gathered from the logs and predict future menaces in an unsupervised way, as well as classifying the past ones.

However, the application's code itself can be of great commercial value, for example in the case of proprietary code or additional functionality obtained as downloadable content and via in-app purchases, which are widely used to monetize free applications through premium content. Developers still rely heavily on obfuscation to protect their own code from unauthorized tampering or copying, providing an obstacle for an attacker, but not preventing compromise. In this paper, we present Tarnhelm, an approach to offer a practical and transparent primitive to implement code confidentiality by extending ARM's TrustZone, a TEE that so far provides limited functionality to application developers. Tarnhelm allows developers to easily designate part of their code as confidential through source code annotations. At compile time, Tarnhelm automatically partitions the application into regular application code, executed in the \"normal world,\" and the invisible code, transparently executed in the \"secure world.\" Tarnhelm tightly couples and secures the execution in both worlds without exposing any additional attack surface by combining a number of different techniques, such as secure code loading, system call forwarding, transparent world switching, and the enforcement of inter-world control-flow integrity. We im- plemented a proof of concept of Tarnhelm and demonstrate its feasibility in a mobile computing setting.","tags":["code confidentiality","trustzone"],"title":"Tarnhelm: Isolated, Transparent \u0026 Confidential Execution of Arbitrary Code in ARM's TrustZone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Giancarlo Sperlı́"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"adcd203a47cc55af0dac95aa325846d2","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2020-survey/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T13:18:25.4981Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2020-survey/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A survey of Big Data dimensions vs Social Networks analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.
