Due to the presence of a multitude of easily exploitable security vulnerabilities, these devices are frequently targeted by malicious users. It follows that it is imperative to conduct thorough security evaluations of IoT devices to detect and prevent possible cyberattacks. To achieve this, it is of utmost importance to adopt comprehensive and reliable methodologies for vulnerability assessment. However, traditional vulnerability assessment techniques require the emulation of firmware in a controlled environment, a process known as firmware re-hosting.

However, it is also used for malicious goals, e.g. virus writers often employ obfuscation in order to evade signature-based antivirus detection. Thus, the ability to detect if an executable has been obfuscated is of paramount importance, as it allows to thwart the execution of potentially malicious code. The task of detection, however, is not easy, since many different obfuscating transformations exist and the alteration of an original code is not always easily detectable. In this paper, we want to shed light on the blurry task of obfuscation detection. We will look at this task through the brand new lenses of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), in order to finally sharpen the obscure landscape of obfuscated software. Thanks to XAI we will be able to identify the relevant features altered by the transformating obfuscation as well as the invariant ones, that can be used for obfuscation-resistant malware signatures. We show our findings thanks to an evaluation with a dataset of obfuscated and non-obfuscated binaries, explaining the important features that lead to the detection of obfuscating transformations.","tags":[""],"title":"Explaining Binary Obfuscation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mila Dalla Preda","Michele Ianni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"18d558a8665f6689aa4e8ffa109879ed","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dalla-preda-2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.94946Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dalla-preda-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Software watermarking is a protection technique which aims at combating software piracy, thus defending intellectual property, by embedding stegosignatures or watermarks into a program.

This paper introduces a secure approach for medical image analysis using federated learning and partially homomorphic encryption within a distributed data fabric architecture.

However, the widespread use of IoT applications in smart cities has resulted in security and privacy concerns that must be addressed to protect sensitive data. To safeguard smart cities from cyber attacks, learning theory-based automated attack-detection methods must be adopted. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to create effective models for identifying IoT attacks. However, the majority of IoT detection algorithms have focused on only a few types of IoT attacks, and most IoT threat detection systems have used black-box deep learning models that lack interpretability to support their forecasts. This research aims to detect several types of large-scale attacks on IoT devices using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost) classifier and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches. The proposed method not only improves the model’s performance but also increases trust in the model.

In a distributed scenario, entities must prove their identity to a trusted third party using shared secrets, such as secret keys. Traditional schemes typically use a trusted central organization, like a Key Distribution Center, for identity authentication. However, Kerberos has some downsides, such as a single point of failure, vulnerability to replay attacks, and potential credential exposure, which can compromise system security. To address these problems, researchers have been working on various solutions, but most have their own drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Kerberos Secure Service-Management Protocol (DKSM) based on blockchain technology and Ciphertext-policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) schema. Compared with existing protocols, DKSM fulfills decentralization, fine-grained access control with effective cost, and scalability simultaneously. DKSM uses AES and Fast Attribute-Based Encryption with Optimal Security (FABEO) as its cryptographic basis. We also discuss the security of DKSM and demonstrate how our protocol can defend against attacks. Finally, tests on the Ethereum testnet and FISCO consortium platform have shown that our designed protocol is efficient and cost-effective.","tags":["internet of things(iot)","kerberos","blockchain","service security"],"title":"DKSM: A Decentralized Kerberos Secure Service-Management Protocol for Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diletta Chiaro","Edoardo Prezioso","Michele Ianni","Fabio Giampaolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"d3b3a078109a0b81c3ac130ec02f47ac","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/chiaro-2023101836/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.950436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chiaro-2023101836/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated Learning (FL), which enables multiple clients to cooperatively train global models without revealing private data, has gained significant attention from researchers in recent years.

In this paper, we propose FL-Enhance, a novel framework to address the non-IID-ness data issue in FL by leveraging established solutions such as data selection, data compression, and data augmentation. FL-Enhance, specifically, utilizes cGANs that are trained locally on the server level, which represents a relatively novel approach within the FL framework. Also, data compression techniques are applied to preserve privacy during data sharing between clients and servers. We compare our framework with the commonly used SMOTE data augmentation technique and test it with different FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedNova, and FedOpt. We conducted experiments using both image and tabular data to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The experimental findings show that FL-Enhance can substantially enhance the performance of the trained models in situations of severe pathological clients while still preserving privacy, which is the fundamental requirement in the FL context.","tags":["federated learning","non-iid data","data fusion","model fusion"],"title":"FL-Enhance: A federated learning framework for balancing non-IID data with augmented and shared compressed samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pian Qi","Diletta Chiaro","Antonella Guzzo","Michele Ianni","Giancarlo Fortino","Francesco Piccialli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"1d6fc57a22f10e289db4b5e8fde51e9d","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/qi-2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.948004Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qi-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) approach that enables models to be trained on client devices while ensuring the privacy of user data. Model aggregation, also known as model fusion, plays a vital role in FL. It involves combining locally generated models from client devices into a single global model while maintaining user data privacy. However, the accuracy and reliability of the resulting global model depend on the aggregation method chosen, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial. Initially, the simple averaging of model weights was the most commonly used method. However, due to its limitations in handling low-quality or malicious models, alternative techniques have been explored. As FL gains popularity in various domains, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the available model aggregation techniques and their respective strengths and limitations. However, there is currently a significant gap in the literature when it comes to systematic and comprehensive reviews of these techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review encompassing 201 studies on model aggregation in FL. The focus is on summarizing the proposed techniques and the ones currently applied for model fusion. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to enhance and develop new aggregation techniques, as well as for practitioners to select the most appropriate method for their FL applications.","tags":["model aggregation","model fusion","federated learning","distributed machine learning","machine learning","artificial intelligence"],"title":"Model aggregation techniques in federated learning: A comprehensive survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"45d5432dfdc6772ebef75a59bcd3de79","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/ianni-2023103355/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.950151Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ianni-2023103355/","section":"publication","summary":"The current increase in cybercrime is demanding more effective and efficient data exploration and analysis solutions that can help analysts to detect cyberattacks.

However, the application's code itself can be of great commercial value, for example in the case of proprietary code or additional functionality obtained as downloadable content and via in-app purchases, which are widely used to monetize free applications through premium content. Developers still rely heavily on obfuscation to protect their own code from unauthorized tampering or copying, providing an obstacle for an attacker, but not preventing compromise. In this paper, we present Tarnhelm, an approach to offer a practical and transparent primitive to implement code confidentiality by extending ARM's TrustZone, a TEE that so far provides limited functionality to application developers. Tarnhelm allows developers to easily designate part of their code as confidential through source code annotations. At compile time, Tarnhelm automatically partitions the application into regular application code, executed in the \"normal world,\" and the invisible code, transparently executed in the \"secure world.\" Tarnhelm tightly couples and secures the execution in both worlds without exposing any additional attack surface by combining a number of different techniques, such as secure code loading, system call forwarding, transparent world switching, and the enforcement of inter-world control-flow integrity.

The main sources for data analysis are the activity logs that are produced in large volumes at run time and are often characterized by semantically rich properties. The paper proposes a framework for analyzing the collected logs in order to provide the defenders with relevant insights on the attacks that have been conducted. The framework consists of two ingredients: (i) a modeling language to define the patterns of attacks that are of interest to the defenders, and (ii) an algorithm that is able to identify, in an input log, all possible attacks conforming to the given patterns. The paper presents a formalization of the modeling language and a study of its properties from a theoretical viewpoint as well as the algorithm (along with an ad-hoc data structure) that is proven to be very efficient in the identification of attacks in real world scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling and efficiently detecting security-critical sequences of actions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sergio Greco","Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Domenico Saccà","Irina Trubitsyna"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0736a9bb6fffca95f51ed61f12e779be","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dblp-confsebd-greco-imst-20/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.95469Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confsebd-greco-imst-20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Smart Data Exchange","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Domenico Saccà"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"cf7f92f34e67b0927270aedd76fa2aff","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dblp-confdata-ianni-ms-19/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.955288Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confdata-ianni-ms-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Overview of the Endless Battle between Virus Writers and Detectors: How Compilers Can Be Used as an Evasion Technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Domenico Saccà"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"986663bde358b4b92695422dff59cc98","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/dblp-confsebd-ianni-ms-19/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.955576Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confsebd-ianni-ms-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exotic Compilers as a Malware Evasion Technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nunziato Cassavia","Sergio Flesca","Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Giuseppe Papuzzo","Chiara Pulice"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"33a939f3290bf93b9ea3b615b6e5decf","permalink":"https://iannim.github.io/publication/cassavia-fimpp-19/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T15:48:36.956225Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cassavia-fimpp-19/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"High Performance Computing by the Crowd","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Ianni","Elio Masciari","Giuseppe M.
