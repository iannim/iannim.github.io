 abstract = {In today's digital age, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital content has become an increasingly critical issue, particularly in legal proceedings where digital evidence plays a crucial role. However, many forms of digital evidence, such as screenshots and recordings, are susceptible to tampering and manipulation, undermining their credibility and admissibility. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework for certifying the validity of digital content, including screenshots, audio recordings, video recordings, and web interactions. At the core of our framework is a modified web browser instance, which prevents users from modifying web content and ensures the integrity of captured screenshots and recordings. Through a secure remote access interface, users can connect to the modified browser and capture screenshots, record web interactions, and certify digital content with confidence. The certification process includes collecting metadata, digitally signing certification packages, and encrypting communication to protect the integrity and confidentiality of certified content. By leveraging a combination of server-side and client-side technologies, our framework provides a reliable and scalable solution for enhancing the integrity of digital evidence, thereby bolstering its admissibility and reliability in legal proceedings and other contexts where integrity is paramount.},
