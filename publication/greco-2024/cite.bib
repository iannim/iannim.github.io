 abstract = {The proliferation of IoT devices and their increasing integration into daily life has led to significant security concerns. Due to the presence of a multitude of easily exploitable security vulnerabilities, these devices are frequently targeted by malicious users. It follows that it is imperative to conduct thorough security evaluations of IoT devices to detect and prevent possible cyberattacks. To achieve this, it is of utmost importance to adopt comprehensive and reliable methodologies for vulnerability assessment. However, traditional vulnerability assessment techniques require the emulation of firmware in a controlled environment, a process known as firmware re-hosting. In this chapter, we provide an analysis of the current re-hosting methods for vulnerability assessment, identify their limitations, and discuss our approach to speed up security evaluations and allow the use of traditional security tools, such as binary fuzzers, to be applied on re-hosted firmware.},
