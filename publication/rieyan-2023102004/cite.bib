 abstract = {Data fabric is an automated and AI-driven data fusion approach to accomplish data management unification without moving data to a centralized location for solving complex data problems. In a Federated learning architecture, the global model is trained based on the learned parameters of several local models that eliminate the necessity of moving data to a centralized repository for machine learning. This paper introduces a secure approach for medical image analysis using federated learning and partially homomorphic encryption within a distributed data fabric architecture. With this method, multiple users or clients (hospitals/medical data centers) can collaborate in training a machine-learning model without exchanging raw data. The approach complies with laws and regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring the privacy and security of the data. The study demonstrates the methodâ€™s effectiveness through a case study on pituitary tumor classification, achieving a significant accuracy of 83.31%. However, the primary focus of the study is using the data fabric architecture to securely store and analyze medical images while complying with HIPAA and GDPR regulations. The results highlight the potential of these techniques to be applied to other privacy-sensitive domains and contribute to the growing body of research on secure and privacy-preserving machine learning.},
